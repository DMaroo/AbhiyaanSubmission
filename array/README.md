# Programming

## I/O format

The program `solve.cpp` take the length of the array, followed by the array as its input. It outputs a single number, which is the amount of swaps necessary to form a contiguous segment of 1. `solve` is an ELF 64-bit compiled binary. It should run on most 64-bit Linux distributions, without needing to compile the source code again.

### Example I/O

*Input:*
```
12
1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1
```

*Output:*
```
12
```
